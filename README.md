# Cyber-Attack-Detection-Using-CNN
## Description

This project focuses on detecting cyber attacks in large-scale networks using machine learning techniques, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and other classifiers like Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is used, which contains network traffic data with various attack types (e.g., DoS, Exploits, Fuzzers) and normal traffic. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing (e.g., encoding, scaling, handling class imbalance with SMOTE), model training, and performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Uses the UNSW-NB15 dataset, which includes various attack types (DoS, Exploits, Fuzzers) and normal traffic.

Includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, SMOTE)
Model training and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
